Unlike theatre, which was largely confined to\n              the centres of cities or large towns, cinema moved very quickly\n              from city centres not only to small towns and rural areas but also\n              to the residential zones on the periphery of urban areas and out\n              into their suburbs.\n            </p>\n            <br></br>\n            <p>\n              In moving out with the population into the new residential\n              suburbs, cinema fundamentally reorganized the geography of\n              commercial entertainment in advance of the arrival of such other\n              media as radio and television, which would bring entertainment\n              into the home. Unlike these increasingly intimate entertainment\n              forms, cinema was also communal: it took place as part of an\n              audience in local areas. As such, it resembled fairs and\n              travelling shows but was distinguished from them by its\n              permanence.\n            </p>\n            <br></br>\n            <p>\n              Cinema became part of everyday life in the suburbs, a constant\n              presence on the local streetscape, like the grocer or butcher. Its\n              affordability even put it within reach of many local children for\n              whom Saturday matinees were organized, often called the “penny\n              rush,” offering cliff-hanger episodes of serials - the\n              “follier-uppers.”\n            </p>\n            <br></br>\n            <p>\n              The economics of suburban cinema in Dublin was consolidated early\n              on by the city’s chief judge, the Recorder, who in the 1910s\n              refused lucrative Sunday licences to any city cinema not serving a\n              working-class population whose labour offered them little\n              opportunity to attend cinema during the week. In the following\n              case study, we will focus on how cinema pushed out into the\n              expanding residential parts of Dublin’s northside, beginning with\n              the north quays, Clontarf, Phibsboro and Stoneybatter in the 1910s\n              and 1920s, and subsequently into the developing suburbs of\n              Druncondra, Fairview, Cabra and Whitehall.\n            </p>\n            <br></br>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 1 - Drogheda Picture Place\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>The Phoenix Picture Palace, Ellis Quay</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1912\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy1,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          Rational, interesting, intelligent and educative amusement,” Dublin’s\n          Lord Mayor Lorcan Sherlock announced as he opened the Phoenix Picture\n          Palace on Ellis Quay on Tuesday, 3 December 1912, “was to be given\n          there to thousands of the working class people of that neighbourhood\n          at very cheap rates.\n        </p>\n      ),\n      id: uuidv4(),\n      quote: (\n        <div>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation-marks\">“</h1>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation\">quote</h1>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      quoteDescription: (\n        <div>\n          <p>description</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      readMore: (\n        <div className=\"read-more-body\">\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Ellis Quay was not suburban, but it was near the western periphery\n            of the city as it pushed towards the Phoenix Park, after which the\n            cinema was named. As such, the Phoenix is the first cinema on\n            Dublin’s northside that opened considerably outside the city centre,\n            which remained the location of such other forms of professional\n            commercial entertainment as theatres.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In this more residential part of the city, observers other than\n            Sherlock had little doubt about the kind of audiences the cinema\n            would be serving. “The theatre will cater principally for the\n            working classes,” columnist Paddy noted in the <i>Bioscope</i>. It\n            was also, as Paddy further noted, “in a very fine position” that\n            meant that it could rely on considerable passing trade from people\n            using the trams that went by its door or on their way to or from\n            such nearby destinations as the Royal Barracks, the Smithfield\n            markets area, James’s Gate Brewery and Kingsbridge railway station.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            A residential population, passing trade and specifically attracted\n            patrons were all needed because the directors of the Phoenix Picture\n            Palace Limited - A.T. Wright, David Frame, John Mackay and Henry\n            Grandy - had speculated on a large and state-of-the-art building\n            capable of seating 1,500 people. To further enhance its attractions,\n            the directors hired popular stage comedian Cathal McGarvey as the\n            Phoenix’s initial manager.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Some of the first big-budget special attractions that McGarvey\n            advertised in the city’s newspapers to draw patrons from other parts\n            of the city were the Italian-made epic of classical{\" \"}\n            <i>Rome Quo Vadis?</i>\n            (Italy: Cines, 1912), an adaptation of Alexander Dumas’{\" \"}\n            <i>The Three Musketeers</i> (France: Film d’Art, 1912) and{\" \"}\n            <i>From the Manger to the Cross</i> (US: Kalem, 1912). The most\n            prominent of all its early productions, From the Manger to the Cross\n            was the first life of Christ to be filmed on location in Palestine\n            and had been produced by the same Kalem Company filmmakers who\n            earlier in 1912 had been shooting in Ireland (see it here).\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Opponents of <i>From the Manger to the Cross</i> held public\n            meetings to have it banned, protesting “the utter undesirability of\n            outraging the religious sentiments of the citizens of Dublin by\n            exhibiting in the form of an entertainment, and for a purely\n            commercial object, the sufferings of Our Blessed Lord, and the more\n            sacred incidents of His life on earth.” However, the film also had\n            many admirers, including among the clergy, and it ran at the Phoenix\n            for an unusually long four-week run from 3-31 March 1913.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The Phoenix’s role in the local working-class community was\n            epitomized later that year by events during the strikes and clashes\n            with employers of the Dublin Lockout of 1913. Unconnected to the\n            strikes themselves but highlighting the slum conditions in which so\n            many of the city’s workers lived, two tenement houses in Church\n            Street collapsed on the evening of 2 September 1913, killing seven\n            people. Not ten-minutes walk away, the Phoenix held a benefit night\n            for the victims on 9 September by adding live singers and comedians\n            - including McGarvey - to its previously booked films. A sum of 353\n            shillings and sevenpence was donated in the Phoenix’s name to the\n            relief fund.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Writer and broadcaster Paddy Crosbie suggests that the Phoenix’s\n            children’s Saturday matinees may have had an even longer lasting\n            impact on the cultural lives of young Dubliners. Born just metres\n            from the Phoenix or “Feeno” in 1913, Crosbie vividly records its\n            “penny rush” of the late 1910s and early 1920s in his memoir{\" \"}\n            <i>Your Dinner’s Poured Out</i>. The single penny entry attracted\n            children from all over the city “from as far away as Fairview,\n            Ringsend or Drumcondra in little groups [that converged] on Ellis\n            Quay, as if drawn by a magnet.” Rituals of sweet-buying beforehand,\n            the tussels and overcrowding in the auditorium, and an uncritical\n            delight in the formulaic films shown were part of the experience of\n            cinemagoing for this segment of the Phoenix’s audience.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 2 - Whitworth Hall's Cinema House\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>Clontarf’s Seaside Picture Palace</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1913\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy2,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          No longer needed for council meetings once the former township of\n          Clontarf was incorporated into Dublin city in 1901, the former\n          Clontarf Town Hall became the first truly suburban cinema north of the\n          Liffey.

Although their venture in\n            Clontarf would be short lived, several other exhibitors would follow\n            them and try their hand at cinema in this desirable, if not densely\n            populated, district.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The availability of such a sizeable building well known within the\n            local community was also propitious. The auditorium seated about 400\n            patrons, charging them 1 shilling, 6 pence or 4 pence. Its\n            projection box was, unusually, constructed outside the building and\n            offered “an extraordinary good view of Dublin harbour, which comes\n            within 100ft. of the entrance gates.” When the reporter for the{\" \"}\n            <i>Bioscope</i> visited it for the opening film <i>Monte Cristo</i>{\" \"}\n            (US: Selig, 1912), s/he noted that “over the entrance gates are\n            strung a series of flags, and a spacious drive, intersected with\n            flower beds, leads up the hall steps.”\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Sir Charles Cameron, Dublin’s long-serving chief medical officer,\n            performed the opening ceremony, receiving the gift of a gold-mounted\n            umbrella and revealing, to applause and laughter, that he was a\n            shareholder in a cinema company “which was paying 20 per cent., and\n            he was only sorry he didn’t sell out all he had and invest the\n            proceeds in a picture house.” Apart from its investment\n            opportunities, cinema, he observed, provided “attractive,\n            educational and appealing entertainment.”\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Despite this promising endorsement from a prominent official, the\n            proprietors had to contend with the vagaries of local conditions.\n            For a start, the building had been and would continue to be a place\n            where meetings of various kinds were held, and as such, despite the\n            abolition of the local council, it resembled mixed-use town halls\n            all over the country. “A surprise awaited the magistrates at the\n            Clontarf Town Hall last week,” the{\" \"}\n            <i>Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly</i> reported at the end of July\n            1913, “when they were about to hold the usual fortnightly petty\n            sessions.

Morrow\n            claimed that Dublin Corporation had undertaken to preserve the use\n            of the hall for the people of Clontarf, that the “cinematograph show\n            was thrust upon the people without consultation” and that its Sunday\n            shows attracted “an objectionable class from the city.” In court and\n            in letters to the newspapers, the proprietors saw off Morrow’s\n            challenge in 1913, but he would continue to object to Sunday opening\n            in particular.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Nevertheless, Brownstein, Humphreys and Mowlds would give up the\n            Clontarf Town Hall sometime in 1914, and another syndicate would\n            reopen the cinema there in 1916, and when that faltered, others\n            would try again in 1917, 1919 and 1920.

Construction work had begun in summer 1913, but even after\n            it had started, alterations were made to the design, probably in\n            order to better compete with the Bohemian Picture Theatre, which was\n            also being built close by on Phibsborough Road. Construction on the\n            Phibsboro, Bohemian and all other Dublin buildings stopped in\n            September 1913 because of the Dublin Lockout’s general strike, but\n            it resumed when builders returned to work in early 1914.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The promoters were William King, a Co.

The building holds, roughly, 600, and the\n            tip-ups [seats] are in Rose Barri shade, the carpets being of a\n            darker colour. The harmonizing effect is thus very beautiful. The\n            balcony, to which admission is covered by the nimble shilling, runs\n            in a wide curve, and has a splendid ‘rake’.” Paddy may not have been\n            paying because the first ads put the prices at 3d, 6d and 9d, the\n            last for the balcony, and not a shilling (12d). Ads also reveal that\n            the performances were continuous from 3 to 10:30 rather than at set\n            times and that the programme changed on Monday and Thursday –\n            initially with no Sunday shows, but these were soon added.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Focused on these details, ads neglected to name the opening film, so\n            the first advertised film at the Phibsboro was the Danish feature{\" \"}\n            <i>In the Shadow of the Throne (I Tronens Skygge;</i> Kinografen,\n            1914). This film told the story of a prince who falls in love with a\n            peasant girl, but when he is forced to marry a princess after\n            becoming head of state, the peasant girl chooses to become a nun.\n            Booked to run for three days beginning on Monday, 1 June, the film’s\n            religious theme attracted the attention of the Catholic Church’s\n            Vigilance Committee. The Committee’s objections culminated with twin\n            brothers William and Francis Larkin shouting in the auditorium\n            during a screening and throwing ink at the screen, splattering the\n            blouse and music of Miss Eager, one of the three musicians\n            accompanying the film.

Although\n            another striking addition to Phibsborough’s streetscape, his design\n            was less decorative and incorporated two small shops on either side\n            of the entrance, each only a single storey in order not to intrude\n            too much on the theatre itself. The facade was, nonetheless,\n            attractive, being “finished in red brick and chiselled limestone\n            dressings, gables and finials,” according to the{\" \"}\n            <i>Irish Builder</i>. The picture house announced itself with a\n            canopy that extended between the shops, and patrons entered the\n            auditorium by climbing a few steps to the box office and lobby.\n            Inside, a wide staircase led to a spacious gallery, while an\n            auditorium 104 feet by 38 feet was furnished with about 900 seats\n            and carpets in shades of blue and topped by an elliptical ceiling\n            finished in decorative fibrous plaster.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            What drew 24-year-old Bohemian owner Frederick Arthur Sparling, a\n            one-time medical student from a merchant family in Scarriff, Co.\n            Clare, to the cinema business is not clear, but he chose to compete\n            with the Phibsboro Picture House by offering a very similar\n            entertainment. Both venues offered continuous performances from 3 to\n            10:30, but the Boh’s prices of 3d, 6d and 1s were slightly higher\n            than the Phibsboro’s 3d, 6d and 9d. The ad for the Boh’s opening\n            promised “refinement, good music and clear, steady pictures.”\n            Supported “by an all round Programme of Amusing Comics and Thrilling\n            Dramas,” the bill was headed by the four-reel British racing drama,{\" \"}\n            <i>In the Hands of London Crooks</i> (Barker, 1914). Sparling likely\n            left film choices largely to the experienced managers he hired,\n            beginning with W. O. Ashton, who had previously worked for a film\n            distribution company.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The Boh’s management increasingly used music to persuade patrons to\n            travel out of the city, helped by the two tram lines that served the\n            area. Yorkshire-born Percy Carver was the cinema’s first musical\n            director,and under his leadership, what ads in summer 1915 called\n            the “finest orchestra in Ireland” had grown to 16 musicians. The Boh\n            also experimented with using concert musicians in December 1915, but\n            when the city-centre Carlton hired virtuoso violinist Erwin\n            Goldwater in early 1916, the Boh regained its musical preeminence by\n            hiring first the concert cellist Clyde Twelvetrees and then the\n            violinist Achille Simonetti. By 1920, the cinema took a different\n            approach to accompaniment by hiring Leslie James to lead the\n            orchestra and provide accompaniment from his pipe organ.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5pNIK25KnE\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 5 - Aimsir Padraig\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>Manor Street Picture House </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1920\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy5,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          On 10 May 1920, the Manor Cinema opened on Manor Street, a residential\n          street that lay north-west of the city between the Liffey and the\n          North Circular Road, about ten-minutes walk north of the Phoenix, in\n          an area dominated by the working-class population of historic\n          Oxmantown and Stoneybatter.\n        </p>\n      ),\n      id: uuidv4(),\n      quote: (\n        <div>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation-marks\">“</h1>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation\">\n            When you go to the Manor next time, it is possible that you may be\n            one of the local attractions.\n          </h1>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      quoteDescription: (\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            <i>Sport</i> 4 September 1920n\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      readMore: (\n        <div className=\"read-more-body\">\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In 1914, builder Michael Whelan had planned to construct a cinema on\n            the site of houses at 60 and 61 Manor Street, but he seems to have\n            run into financial difficulties, and the idea for a cinema on this\n            site was instead realised in 1920 by the Fagans, a well-known Dublin\n            musical family resident in the area. Managed by George Fagan, the\n            Manor offered strong musical accompaniment from a six-piece\n            orchestra led by violinist Terry O’Connor and including Kitty and\n            Lily Fagan on cello and piano, respectively. The main opening film\n            was <i>He Comes Up Smiling</i> (US: Fairbanks, 1918), a comedy\n            starring Douglas Fairbanks. Dublin newspapers reviewed the opening\n            favourably but briefly, the <i>Irish Independent</i> noting its\n            “excellent programme of pictures and music, and full houses. The\n            theatre is luxuriously fitted throughout.”\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Unlike the other early suburban cinemas considered here, the Manor\n            was not located on a tram line. As a result, the management had to\n            work particularly hard over the course of the 1920s to attract\n            patrons from outside its immediate vicinity, and it did this in a\n            variety of ways that went beyond the choice of feature films and\n            music. These included filming people in the city streets, offering\n            weeks of Irish films and staging talent contests.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Beginning at the end of August 1920, the management hired camera\n            operators from the Hugh Stanley Company to distribute handbills in\n            city-centre streets inviting people to be filmed and to see\n            themselves later on screen at the Manor. “Large crowds of people\n            took advantage of the opportunity to ‘act’ for the films,” the{\" \"}\n            <i>Kinematograph Weekly</i> asserted. \"When you go to the Manor next\n            time,” <i>Sport</i> claimed, “it is possible that you may be one of\n            the local attractions.” Although this kind of filming in the streets\n            was presented as a novelty, it was also one of the ways that the\n            very first filmmakers twenty years previously had attracted patrons\n            to their shows.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In October 1920, the Manor presented its first “All Irish Week.” The\n            bill featured the romantic drama{\" \"}\n            <i>When Love Came to Gavin Burke, Rafferty’s Rise</i>, a comedy\n            about a rural policeman, and some “scenics,” short films of Irish\n            beauty spots. All of these were made by the Film Company of Ireland,\n            the country’s main producer of feature films.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            It is difficult to judge the effectiveness of these strategies, but\n            in 1923, the Fagans attempted unsuccessfully to sell the Manor. They\n            succeeded in selling the cinema in October 1928, when it was taken\n            over by Kenneth L. Gregg, who changed its name to the Palladium and\n            introduced programming that featured a mixture of films and live\n            variety acts, as well as local talent contests. The cinema would\n            change management and identity again in 1934, when it became the\n            Broadway, and it was under this name that it continued until its\n            closure in 1956.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 6 - The Abbey Cinema\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>The Fairview Grand</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1929\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy6,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          The opening of the Fairview Grand on 18 November 1929 marked the\n          beginning of a period of rapid expansion for Dublin’s suburban cinema\n          network.

Despite the emergence of\n            this technological innovation, the Fairview Grand’s offering was\n            initially focussed on silent films with live musical accompaniment.\n            The house orchestra was led by John Moody, a name that would have\n            been familiar to seasoned Dublin cinema-goers, particularly those\n            who frequented the Theatre Royal, where Moody had previously worked\n            as musical director.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            On opening night at the Grand, the first assignment for Moody’s\n            orchestra was to provide the musical accompaniment for{\" \"}\n            <i>The Trail of ‘98</i> (US: Brown, 1928). Starring Dolores del Rio\n            and Ralph Forbes, the film had its Irish premiere at the Corinthian\n            on 4 August 1929. An epic tale of the American gold rush, the{\" \"}\n            <i>Irish Independent’s</i> film critic of the day deemed it a\n            ‘thrilling story’ that ‘ranks high amongst the triumphs of the\n            screen’ (13 August 1929). After a successful twenty day run at the\n            Corinthian, <i>The Trail of ‘98</i> circulated to a small number of\n            cinemas outside of Dublin for screenings in Cashel, Cavan and\n            Drogheda. While the film had enjoyed something of an extended run at\n            the Corinthian, the screening at the Fairview Grand on 18 November\n            1929 marked the film’s transition to the second run suburban\n            circuit.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Apart from the novelty of the new cinema itself, the programming of\n            a film featuring the Mexican star Del Rio would have undoubtedly\n            caught the attention of local Dublin cinema-goers whose name\n            appeared on film posters and press advertisements with increasing\n            frequency in the late 1920s. Indeed, <i>The Trail of ‘98</i> was Del\n            Rio’s last fully silent film before the release of <i>Evangeline</i>{\" \"}\n            (US: Carewe, 1929), which was released in Ireland in January 1930.\n            Featuring musical numbers by Del Rio, <i>Evangeline</i>, as the{\" \"}\n            <i>Evening Herald</i> film columnist noted, was described as the\n            ‘swan song of the silent screen’ (25 January 1930). It was against\n            this backdrop of imminent change that the Fairview Grand entered\n            Dublin’s cinema scene.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 7 - On stage at the Gate cinema\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>The expansion of the Grand cinema circuit</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1934\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy7,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          On 19 October 1934, Leonard Ging expanded his circuit of suburban\n          cinemas with the opening of the Drumcondra Grand.\n        </p>\n      ),\n      id: uuidv4(),\n      quote: (\n        <div>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation-marks\">“</h1>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation\">\n            The cinema [is] a credit to Irish workmanship and to Irish hands\n          </h1>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      quoteDescription: (\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            Lord Mayor Alfie Byrne on the opening of the Drumcondra Grand,{\" \"}\n            <i>Saturday Herald</i>, 20 October 1934\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      readMore: (\n        <div className=\"read-more-body\">\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Located less than two kilometres from the Fairview Grand, Drumcondra\n            was the second suburban area on the northside to benefit from the\n            expansion of Leonard Ging’s cinema enterprise. The Drumcondra Grand\n            or the Drummer, as it would fondly be referred to by local\n            cinema-goers, opened its doors almost exactly five years after the\n            Fairview Grand. Dublin’s then Lord Mayor Alfie Bynre officiated at\n            the opening ceremony during which he praised the cinema’s directors\n            for ‘providing a place of entertainment, suitable to the\n            requirements of that rapidly growing district’ (\n            <i>Saturday Herald</i>, 20 October 1934, p.7). This rapid\n            development was linked to an increased availability of residential\n            properties in the area, which drew many families out of the city\n            centre and into suburban areas. The shift in the distribution of\n            Dublin’s population is reflected in the fact that during the ten\n            year period from 1926 to 1936, the population of Drumcondra rose by\n            63 per cent (Brady, 2014: 40).\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In January 1934, the writer of the ‘Dublin Letter’ column for{\" \"}\n            <i>The Cork Examiner</i> commented on the recent changes in the\n            capital and its surrounding areas, noting that ‘suburbs have sprung\n            up stretching from Clontarf to Glasnevin and Ballymun and they are\n            provided with all the amenities, except cinemas, now demanded by the\n            town dweller’ (8 January 1934). As we’ve seen with the case of the\n            Fairview Grand, northsiders weren’t entirely deprived of a local\n            cinema, but the rapid growth of population in the surrounding areas\n            meant that by the early 1930s there was significant demand for\n            additional suburban cinemas.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Born in 1938, local cinema-goer Leo vividly recalls queuing outside\n            the Drummer on a Sunday for a fourpenny seat. As Leo explains, being\n            near the top of the queue didn’t always guarantee a ticket as those\n            who were served first would often bulk buy tickets for their friends\n            at the back of the queue. His memory of the ‘crush’ that ensued once\n            the cinema gates were opened captures the sheer demand for suburban\n            entertainment throughout the 1940s:{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibPCHcXDpAs\" />\n          </div>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In January 1954, in an effort to keep attracting cinema-goers, the\n            Drumcondra Grand invested in new projection and sound equipment.\n            Promising a ‘brighter picture’ and ‘more perfect sound’, it was\n            reported that the new technology was ‘the first of its kind in any\n            suburban cinema in the country’ (<i>Evening Herald</i>, 6 January\n            1953, p.2). The retrofit came just over a year before Dublin 9\n            cinema-goers would have the option of a brand new picture house less\n            than three kilometres away on Collins Avenue. Leo recalls how the\n            lure of the more modern and luxurious Whitehall Grand drew\n            cinema-goers like himself away from the Drummer:\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLEXZR8qC-U\" />\n          </div>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            As the following sections of this case study illustrate, the rapid\n            expansion of the Grand Cinema circuit in the late 1940s and early\n            1950s meant that the suburban cinema would go from being an amenity\n            that was in demand to one that was in over supply.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 8 - Action on and off the screen\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>The Strand: Between the City and the Suburbs</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1938\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy8,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          Deviating a little from the Grand circuit’s naming convention, the\n          Strand Cinema on North Strand Road became the newest member of Leonard\n          Ging’s chain when it opened on Easter Saturday, 16 April 1938.

That same Saturday\n            saw three other openings that together with the Strand’s 1,400 seats\n            added 8,000 cinema seats to the city’s total. On the same route into\n            the city centre, the Talbot Street Electric Theatre had been greatly\n            expanded and renamed the New Electric. In existence since 1911,\n            Dubliners had ascribed the Talbot Street cinema with a number of\n            nicknames over the years. As local cinema-goer John recalls,\n            youngsters like himself knew it only as the ‘Lec’ or a variation of\n            the same:\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsyG96vF4Ao\" />\n          </div>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The third cinema to open that Saturday in April 1938 was the Regal\n            Rooms. Located beside the mammoth Theatre Royal on Hawkins Street,\n            it was the smallest of the new cinemas but aimed to be Dublin’s most\n            comfortable cinema by offering “noiseless seat-hinges, hidden\n            lighting, stadium effect in the auditorium and noiseless\n            sound-system.” The Carlton on O’Connell Street was also\n            reconstructed but on a much greater scale to become one of the city\n            centre’s “super” cinemas boasting 3,000 seats.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            In this context, who was this new suburban cinema serving? In\n            officially opening the Strand having also opened the New Electric,\n            Lord Mayor Alfie Byrne stated that he knew that the Strand\n            “management would cater especially for the youth and would present\n            films in keeping with the needs and ideals of youth.” This was a\n            line that a promotional article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> had\n            also stressed. Under the heading “For the Kiddies,” it observed that\n            “a distinctive feature of the programmes will be the selective care\n            exercised in those intended for children and younger people\n            generally. This is certainly an aspect of cinema entertainment that\n            will appeal strongly to parents and guardians.” This catering for\n            young people wasn’t immediately apparent in the films advertised.\n            The opening feature <i>Love Under Fire</i> (US: Twentieth Century\n            Fox, 1937) was “topically enough, a Spanish war story,” starring Don\n            Ameche and Loretta Young, with just the Pop-Eye cartoon among the\n            supporting items having obvious appeal for children.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            As John explains, the programming choices at the Strand often drew\n            large crowds, but this meant that there was a risk of being turned\n            away. For a young cinema-goer, the less luxurious New Electric was a\n            more attractive option when it offered a better guarantee of an\n            afternoon’s entertainment:\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oa7UBP6YT-k\" />\n          </div>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            While John is typical of the local cinema-goer who came to the\n            Strand by foot, the cinema’s management also aimed to attract and\n            cater for patrons travelling into the city by car. Evidence of this\n            is provided by the mention in the opening ads of a “spacious car\n            park available for our patrons.” This car park was, according to the{\" \"}\n            <i>Evening Herald’s</i> promotional article, “one of the most\n            commodious in Dublin [and] certainly a most acceptable service.”\n            Ging had provided a carpark for his Sutton Grand, which had opened\n            two years previously in the much more distant suburb of Sutton. The\n            Strand had a far larger local population than the Sutton and was\n            well served with public transport, with the coastal trams from the\n            city to Fairview, Clontarf and beyond passing its doors. But the\n            management believed that a significant number of patrons would drive\n            to the cinema.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 9 - Usherette wanted\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>Cabra Grand in the new Republic</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1949\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy9,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          The Cabra Grand became the Republic of Ireland’s first new cinema when\n          it opened on Saturday, 16 April 1949, the same weekend that Ireland\n          became a republic.

Like the Fairview, Drumcondra and Sutton Grands\n            and the Strand before it, the Cabra Grand was conceived as an\n            expansion of Leondard Ging’s north Dublin suburban circuit. Along\n            with these cinemas except Sutton, it was part of a deal in March\n            1949 that saw it taken over on 16 April by Irish Cinemas Ltd, one of\n            the companies controlled by British cinema tycoon J. Arthur Rank.\n            All the more important, perhaps, that it stress its Irish\n            credentials.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Its first manager was well-known republican Louis Marie, who had\n            recently been assistant manager of Dublin’s Theatre Royal. The son\n            of a French army photographer and Irish mother, Marie had\n            participated in the Irish War of Independence from the 1910s on,\n            initially as a member of the Republican boy scouts Fianna Eireann\n            during the 1916 Rising and joining the Free State Army after its\n            formation in 1922.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            At the opening, Marie handed the gold scissors to cut the ceremonial\n            tricolour ribbon to the Lord Mayor of Dublin John Breen, a Labour\n            Party councillor. “The cinema has become part of our daily lives,”\n            the <i>Irish Press</i> quoted Breen as saying. “I am a fairly keen\n            cinema fan myself.” Located on Quarry Road, in the middle of the\n            large work-class housing estate of Cabra, the cinema had the largest\n            capacity of the Grands with over 1,600 seats and boasted one of the\n            widest proscenium arches in Ireland, measuring 43 feet. It had been\n            designed by Samuel Lyons of Henry Lyons and Sons, the architectural\n            firm responsible for all the Grands.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The cinema settled into decades of serving Cabra’s cinemagoers, and\n            it received little press coverage during this period. What little\n            coverage it did receive had contrasting qualities, concerned with,\n            on the one hand, such criminal behaviour as robberies or the\n            harassment of staff, and on the other, such charitable acts as\n            visits by poor children or fund-raising events.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Photos of children from local charitable institutions occasionally\n            appeared in Dublin’s newspapers.

For young and committed 1950s\n            cinema-goers like William, the suburban cinema lacked\n            ‘sophistication’. As soon as he was old enough, William gave up his\n            local suburban cinema and would head into the city centre for his\n            weekly film fix. While venturing further from home was part of\n            growing up, as William explains, the city centre cinemas also\n            promised a more serious film viewing experience:\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiMEh7IXFF4 \" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //////////////////////////////// Case Study 10 - Quiz nights and dancing\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    {\n      title: (\n        <div>\n          <p>Whitehall Grand: a ‘super-luxury’ cinema for Dublin 9</p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      date: \"1954\",\n      imageURL: CaseStudy10,\n      section: (\n        <p>\n          The Whitehall Grand was an entirely modern cinema with a seating\n          capacity of 1000. It was the last of the Grand circuit cinemas to be\n          built and in many ways, its opening in July 1954, and subsequent\n          closure twenty years later charts the decline of the suburban cinema.\n        </p>\n      ),\n      id: uuidv4(),\n      quote: (\n        <div>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation-marks\">“</h1>\n          <h1 className=\"quotation\">\n            The hall majestically sets off the surrounding suburban houses\n          </h1>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      quoteDescription: (\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            <i>The Irish Press</i>, 31 July 1954\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n      readMore: (\n        <div className=\"read-more-body\">\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Like all of the Grand cinemas, the Whitehall Grand was designed by\n            Henry J. Lyons and Partners. While the exterior replicated the\n            design used for many of the suburban cinemas built at this time, the\n            interior of the Whitehall Grand was devised with the wide-screen\n            format in mind. Press coverage of the cinema’s opening highlighted\n            the investment that the owners had made to offer suburban audiences\n            a state-of-the-art film viewing experience. So as not to detract\n            from the viewing experience, the designers opted to forego the usual\n            proscenium arch around the screen. This more minimalist approach was\n            to allow cinema-goers feel ‘part of the action’, while\n            simultaneously making the viewing experience ‘restful to the eyes’ (\n            <i>Irish Press</i>, 31 July 1954). Soft downlighting would also\n            enhance the cinema-going experience by helping patrons to avoid ‘the\n            annoying groping for one’s seat’ (<i>Evening Herald</i>, 30 July\n            1954).\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            The Whitehall Grand served a ‘thickly populated’ catchment area (\n            <i>Irish Independent</i>, 17 June 1955) that extended to Beaumont\n            and Donnycarney. Although the cinema didn’t have a car park, it was\n            well connected by Dublin’s bus network and its position just off the\n            Swords Road, one of the main thoroughfares out of the city centre,\n            made the Grand accessible to patrons coming from other parts of the\n            city. While the Whitehall Grand was less opulent than the city\n            centre’s first run picture houses, the directors of Irish Cinemas\n            Ltd were nevertheless keen to offer suburban audiences a high\n            quality experience. Their commitment to bringing ‘its suburban\n            patrons the best in <i>entertainment</i>’ points to the way the\n            Whitehall Grand would adapt to changing trends and leisure time\n            preferences in the coming years.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            Tapping into the craze for yo-yos among its younger patrons, in May\n            1963, the Whitehall Grand hosted a local heat for the Evening\n            Herald’s yo-yo contest, which was to be judged by yo-yo champion\n            Billy Panama. Something of a celebrity figure among young suburban\n            cinema-goers, Panama performed displays of his yo-yo mastery at a\n            number of Dublin cinemas in the late 1950s. A regular patron of the\n            Grand cinema circuit, Brian recalls Panama’s appearance in Fairview\n            as part of the cinema’s alternative programming:\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <div className=\"video-container-2\">\n            <ResponsiveEmbed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oe3bDGAjQVU\" />\n          </div>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            While this diversification in the Grand circuit’s entertainment\n            offering was enthusiastically received by young audiences, it is\n            also indicative of the challenges that suburban cinemas were facing\n            when it came to being able to fill out these capacious venues. Five\n            months prior to Panama’s appearance at the Whitehall Grand, the\n            cinema’s owners had submitted an application requesting a\n            re-classification of four of the Grand cinemas’ run status. Making\n            front page news in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 31 January 1963, the\n            request to move the cinemas from a ‘B’ to a ‘C’ grading was\n            indicative of the financial pressure that the suburban cinema was\n            under. As a ‘C’ grade cinema, the venues would reduce their\n            operational hours by opening at 6pm rather than 3pm, thereby\n            reducing the number of hours that employees would need to be paid\n            for. The ‘C’ grading would also push employees into a lower pay\n            band.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          <p>\n            By September of the same year, the suburban cinema took a new\n            direction when it expanded its entertainment offering to include\n            Bingo nights. Commenting on its bilingual Bingo partnership with the\n            Irish language and culture organisation Gael-Linn, the{\" \"}\n            <i>Evening Herald</i> reported that ‘the rent offered by Gael-Linn\n            was so high that the cinema group could not refuse it’ (16 September\n            1963).\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    //ADD MORE CASE STUDIES HERE\n  ];\n}\n\nexport default caseStudy2_array;\n","C:\\Users\\pauri\\Documents\\Web Design\\Irish Cinema Histories\\irish-cinema-histories\\src\\data_CaseStudy3.js",[],"C:\\Users\\pauri\\Documents\\Web Design\\Irish Cinema Histories\\irish-cinema-histories\\src\\data_CaseStudy2.js",[],"C:\\Users\\pauri\\Documents\\Web Design\\Irish Cinema Histories\\irish-cinema-histories\\src\\data_CaseStudy4.js",[],"C:\\Users\\pauri\\Documents\\Web Design\\Irish Cinema Histories\\irish-cinema-histories\\src\\components\\mapStyles.js",[],{"ruleId":"134","replacedBy":"135"},{"ruleId":"136","replacedBy":"137"},{"ruleId":"138","severity":1,"message":"139","line":12,"column":8,"nodeType":"140","messageId":"141","endLine":12,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"138","severity":1,"message":"142","line":13,"column":8,"nodeType":"140","messageId":"141","endLine":13,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"138","severity":1,"message":"143","line":14,"column":8,"nodeType":"140","messageId":"141","endLine":14,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"138","severity":1,"message":"144","line":15,"column":8,"nodeType":"140","messageId":"141","endLine":15,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"145","severity":1,"message":"146","line":119,"column":19,"nodeType":"147","endLine":119,"endColumn":34},{"ruleId":"148","severity":1,"message":"149","line":685,"column":11,"nodeType":"150","endLine":685,"endColumn":37},{"ruleId":"148","severity":1,"message":"149","line":1018,"column":11,"nodeType":"150","endLine":1018,"endColumn":37},"no-native-reassign",["151"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["152"],"no-unused-vars","'Sponsors01' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'Sponsors02' is defined but never used.","'Sponsors03' is defined but never used.","'Sponsors04' is defined but never used.","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","JSXAttribute","jsx-a11y/heading-has-content","Headings must have content and the content must be accessible by a screen reader.","JSXOpeningElement","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
